          <p>
            This portfolio website is built using React with TypeScript for the frontend, showcasing modern web development practices.<br/> 
            The backend infrastructure demonstrates my expertise in Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and AWS services.<br/>
            The system follows microservices architecture principles with proper separation of concerns, 
            automated deployment pipelines, and comprehensive monitoring solutions.<br/>
          </p>
          <p>
            Key features include responsive design, component-based architecture, and integration with various 
            backend services for contact forms and scheduling functionality. The entire system is containerized 
            and deployed using CI/CD practices with infrastructure as code.
